# Overview

ToDo app using Flask and Mongo.

I started out following [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-flask-with-mongodb-and-docker), 
however it turned out to be out of date and the docker-compose file didn't behave as expected, so I ended up consulting various sources
and tutorials instead of just following one.
